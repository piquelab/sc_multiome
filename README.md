# Project GxE single multiomic analysis

We performed a series of  analyses in the following folders,
- The folder `analysis_multiome_JW_2023-06-03` contains script for displaying results and plots for manuscript.   
- Baseline analyses in the folder `analysis_multiomic_2023-03-27` By Mohammed 
- annotation genetic variants that are used for `torus` and `dap-g` in the folder `genetic_variant_annot`
- Whole blood eQTL analysis including torus and dap-g in the folder `gtex_v8`
- GWAS analysis in the folder `gwas`   

We used "BH" from p.adjust to calculate FDR as default approach.    
In default, we used all the genes passing filtering conditions to calculate FDR and after that we extracte protein coding genes.
