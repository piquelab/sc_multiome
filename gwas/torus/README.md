# torus for gwas 

Default we use threshold top 10% to define response motif for each condition (FDR<0.1) in the current path and run torus using the joint model. 
The folder `analysis2_th0.2` defines response motif at threshold top 20% and also use joint model for torus. 
The folder `analysis3_each` defines response motif at threshold top 10% and run torus for separately.
